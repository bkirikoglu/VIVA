###Hi Stan!

#####My main presentation file is WBData.Rmd you can see how I extracted and manipulated the data. And then I loaded the .csv file on Tableau and made Dashboard1,2,3 they respectively represent all years, 2008 then 1998.

#####Let me know if you have any trouble finding what you need I also upladed the .twb file so you can see what I did on Tableau.

###Table of Contents
1. See [WBData.Rmd](https://github.com/bkirikoglu/VIVA/blob/master/WBData.Rmd)
2. Open [Book1DATA.twb](https://github.com/bkirikoglu/VIVA/blob/master/Book1DATA.twb) 
3. After Part 4 Resume [WBData.Rmd](https://github.com/bkirikoglu/VIVA/blob/master/WBData.Rmd) from Findings
4. The End
