###Hi Stan!

#####My main presentation file is WBData.Rmd you can see how I extracted and manipulated the data. And then I loaded the .csv file on Tableau and made Dashboard1,2,3 they respectively represent all years, 2008 then 1998.

#####Let me know if you have any trouble finding what you need I also upladed the .twb file so you can see what I did on Tableau.

#####Thanks!
